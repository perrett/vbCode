ябThe tree to the left displays a list of system configurable items.  Each item has a default value and may have one or more location and/or user overriders.  The default value is used only if the person using the system is not within one of the locations listed in the location overriders section and is not logged in using one of the usernames listed in the user overrider section.  If a user is both within a location and user overrider, the user overrider will take precedence.
