ÿThe picklist editor allows you to define picklists used as part of a test request rule.  Setting up a data entry rule type of picklist will allow you to select the picklist you wish to show to the user.  This screen allows you to add and remove values from an existing picklist, and to change the name and multichoice options.  Setting a picklist to multichoice allows the user to select more than one item from the picklist.  This is useful for setting up a time series picklist where you may wish the user to select multiple time options.
